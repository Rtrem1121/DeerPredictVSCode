## 🎉 WHAT YOU GET

### Before Authorization (Current):
```
⚠️ Using synthetic vegetation data
⚠️ Estimated habitat conditions
⚠️ Basic terrain analysis
```

### After Authorization:
```
🛰️ Live Landsat/Sentinel satellite imagery
🌿 Real NDVI vegetation health (updated every 16 days)
🍃 Current crop/mast production mapping
💧 Real water source conditions
📈 Significantly improved prediction accuracy
```

---

## 🔍 EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

### Current Prediction:
*"Based on estimated vegetation conditions..."*

### With Satellite Data:
*"Based on Landsat imagery from August 12, 2025 showing NDVI 0.72 (excellent vegetation health) in food plots..."*

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:

**Authentication Failed?**
- Verify service account has Earth Engine permissions
- Check that Earth Engine API is enabled
- Ensure service account is registered at code.earthengine.google.com

**Credentials File Not Found?**
- Check path: `credentials/gee-service-account.json`
- Verify JSON file is valid (not corrupted)

**Import Errors?**
```bash
pip install earthengine-api
```
