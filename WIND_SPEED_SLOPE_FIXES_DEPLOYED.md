## 🔧 **Changes Implemented:**

### **Fix 1: Wind Speed-Based Thermal Priority** ⭐ CRITICAL FIX

**Problem**: Code only checked thermal strength, not prevailing wind strength  
**User Observation**: "At 6 PM, unless there's 20+ mph wind, thermals dominate"

**File**: `enhanced_bedding_zone_predictor.py` Lines 1510-1570

**Before**:
```python
if evening_thermal["strength"] > 0.3:  # Only checks thermal strength
    # Use thermal + prevailing wind (5-20%)
else:  # Weak thermal
    # Use prevailing wind (40% weight) ❌ WRONG when wind is weak!
    evening_bearing = combine_bearings(
        downhill_direction,
        downwind_direction,
        0.6, 0.4  # 40% wind even if only 4.8 mph!
    )
```

**After**:
```python
wind_speed_mph = weather_data.get('wind', {}).get('speed', 0)

# Thermal dominates unless prevailing wind > 20 mph
if thermal_is_active and wind_speed_mph < 20:  # THERMAL DOMINATES
    # Wind weight scales with WIND SPEED:
    if wind_speed_mph < 5:
        wind_weight = 0.0    # No prevailing wind effect
    elif wind_speed_mph < 10:
        wind_weight = 0.05   # 5% prevailing wind
    elif wind_speed_mph < 15:
        wind_weight = 0.15   # 15% prevailing wind
    else:  # 15-20 mph
        wind_weight = 0.25   # 25% prevailing wind
    
    logger.info(f"🌅 THERMAL DOMINANT: Wind speed={wind_speed_mph:.1f}mph, Wind weight={wind_weight:.0%}")
    
elif wind_speed_mph >= 20:  # STRONG WIND OVERRIDES THERMAL
    # Strong wind (>20 mph) overrides thermal
    wind_weight = 0.6  # 60% prevailing wind dominates
    logger.info(f"💨 WIND DOMINANT: Wind speed={wind_speed_mph:.1f}mph (>20mph overrides thermal)")
    
else:  # No thermal, weak wind
    # Scale wind weight with speed
    wind_weight = min(0.4, wind_speed_mph / 50)
    logger.info(f"🦌 DEER MOVEMENT: Wind speed={wind_speed_mph:.1f}mph, Wind weight={wind_weight:.0%}")
```

### **Fix 2: Lowered Slope Threshold from 10° to 5°** 

**Problem**: 8.3° slope treated as "flat" → everything positioned by wind  
**Solution**: Even gentle slopes (5-10°) have directional deer movement

**Files Changed**:
- Bedding Zone 1 (Primary): Line 667 → `if slope > 5`
- Bedding Zone 2 (Secondary): Line 698 → `if slope > 5`
- Bedding Zone 3 (Escape): Line 709 → `if slope > 5`
- Feeding Zone 1 (Primary): Line 1733 → `if slope > 5`
- Feeding Zone 3 (Emergency): Line 1763 → `if slope > 5`
- Evening Stand Safety Check: Line 1573 → `if slope > 5`

**Impact**:
```
OLD Threshold (10°):
  Slope 8.3° = "Flat" → Wind-based positioning
  
NEW Threshold (5°):
  Slope 8.3° = "Sloped" → Terrain-based positioning
  - Bedding: UPHILL (south, 180°)
  - Feeding: DOWNHILL (north, 0°)
  - Stands: DOWNHILL (north, on deer routes)
```

## 📊 **Impact on Your Cases:**

### **Case 1: Your 6 PM Hunt (Slope 8.3°, Wind 4.8 mph)**

**OLD Behavior**:
```
Slope: 8.3° < 10° = "Flat terrain"
  → Bedding: Leeward (167° SSE) - SOUTH ❌
  → Evening stand: 60% deer + 40% wind = 67° ENE ❌
  → Result: Stands ABOVE bedding!
```

**NEW Behavior**:
```
Slope: 8.3° > 5° = "Sloped terrain"
  → Bedding: Uphill (180° S) - SOUTH ✅
  
Wind: 4.8 mph < 5 mph
  → Evening stand: 100% thermal+deer (0° N) - NORTH ✅
  → Result: Stands BELOW bedding! (Correct interception)
```

---

### **Case 2: 6 PM with Strong Wind (Slope 8.3°, Wind 25 mph)**

**NEW Behavior**:
```
Slope: 8.3° > 5° = "Sloped terrain"
  → Bedding: Uphill (180° S) ✅
  
Wind: 25 mph > 20 mph
  → WIND DOMINANT mode
  → Evening stand: 40% deer + 60% wind = ~100° E
  → Result: Stand positioned for STRONG prevailing wind (correct!)
```

**Biological Validation**: ✅  
Strong sustained wind DOES override thermal drafts - correctly modeled!

---

### **Case 3: Flat Terrain (Slope 3°, Wind 10 mph)**

**NEW Behavior**:
```
Slope: 3° < 5° = "Truly flat terrain"
  → Bedding: Leeward (wind-based) ✅
  → Feeding: Canopy-based ✅
  → No elevation stratification (correct for flat land)
```

**Biological Validation**: ✅  
On true flats (< 5°), wind positioning is appropriate!

## 🌡️ **Wind Speed Thresholds:**

### **Thermal Dominance Curve**:

| Wind Speed | Wind Weight | Thermal Influence | Condition |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0-5 mph | 0% | **100%** | Calm - Full thermal control |
| 5-10 mph | 5% | **95%** | Light breeze - Thermal dominant |
| 10-15 mph | 15% | **85%** | Moderate - Thermal still dominant |
| 15-20 mph | 25% | **75%** | Strong breeze - Thermal barely dominant |
| **20+ mph** | **60%** | **40%** | **STRONG WIND OVERRIDES THERMAL** |

### **Your Field Observations Validated**:

✅ **"At 6 PM, unless there's 20+ mph wind, thermals dominate"**  
- Wind < 20 mph → Thermal priority mode
- Wind > 20 mph → Wind override mode

✅ **"Wind is moving west-ish" (downslope thermal, not prevailing NNW)**  
- 4.8 mph wind → 0% prevailing wind weight
- Evening bearing = 100% thermal + deer (both downhill)

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **Your 8.3° Slope, 6 PM Hunt, 4.8 mph Wind**:

**Bedding Zones** (All uphill/south):
```
Zone 1: 180° (S) - Uphill primary ✅
Zone 2: 210° (SSW) - Uphill variation (+30°) ✅
Zone 3: 180° (S) - Uphill escape ✅
```

**Stand Sites** (All downhill/north):
```
Site 1 (Evening): ~0° (N) - Straight downhill ✅
  - Wind weight: 0% (4.8 mph < 5 mph)
  - Thermal + deer: 100%
  - On deer travel route!
  
Site 2 (Morning): ~180° (S) - Uphill/crosswind ✅
  - Intercept deer returning uphill to bedding
  
Site 3 (All-Day): 167° (SSE) - Downwind ✅
  - Standard downwind positioning
```

**Feeding Zones** (All downhill/north):
```
Zone 1: 0° (N) - Downhill to valley ✅
Zone 2: 77° (ENE) - Crosswind browse ✅
Zone 3: 0° (N) - Downhill to water ✅
```

**Spatial Layout**:
```
                RIDGE (South, High)
                        ↑
                [BEDDING 1, 2, 3]
                        ↑
                  Input Point
                        ↓
            [STAND 2, 3] (Mid-slope)
                        ↓
                  [STAND 1]
                        ↓
                [FEEDING 1, 2, 3]
                        ↓
                VALLEY (North, Low)
```

**Perfect vertical stratification!** 🎯

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist:**

### **Run new prediction at your 6 PM location and verify**:

1. ✅ **All bedding zones SOUTH** (uphill, ~180°)
2. ✅ **All feeding zones NORTH** (downhill, ~0°)
3. ✅ **Evening stand NORTH** (downhill, on deer route)
4. ✅ **Stands BETWEEN bedding and feeding** (mid-slope interception)
5. ✅ **Look for logs**:
   - `🌅 THERMAL DOMINANT: Wind speed=4.8mph, Wind weight=0%`
   - `🏔️ BEDDING: Uphill placement... on 8.3° slope`
   - `🌾 FEEDING: Slope=8.3° - placing DOWNHILL...`

---

## 💡 **Key Improvements:**

### **1. Wind Speed Awareness** ⭐
- Code now checks **BOTH** thermal AND wind strength
- Matches field observations (20 mph threshold)
- Dynamic wind weighting (0-60% based on speed)

### **2. Slope Sensitivity** 
- Lowered threshold from 10° to 5°
- Even gentle slopes (5-10°) use terrain logic
- Only true flats (< 5°) use pure wind positioning

### **3. Biological Accuracy**
- Thermal drafts dominate at sunset (unless strong wind)
- Deer movement follows terrain (not prevailing wind)
- Vertical stratification on ALL slopes > 5°

---

## 📝 **Log Messages to Watch For:**

### **Thermal Dominant (Expected at 6 PM, 4.8 mph wind)**:
```
🌅 THERMAL DOMINANT: Evening bearing=0°, Wind speed=4.8mph, Wind weight=0%, Thermal phase=peak_evening_downslope
```

### **Wind Dominant (Would appear with 25+ mph wind)**:
```
💨 WIND DOMINANT: Evening bearing=100°, Wind speed=25.0mph (>20mph overrides thermal)
```

### **Slope-Based Positioning**:
```
🏔️ BEDDING: Uphill placement aligns with wind (uphill=180°, leeward=167°)
🏔️ SECONDARY BEDDING: Uphill variation (210°) on 8.3° slope
🌾 FEEDING: Slope=8.3° - placing DOWNHILL (0°) for valley food sources
```

## 🎯 **Summary:**

**Problem 1**: Code didn't check prevailing wind strength → Used 40% wind weight even at 4.8 mph  
**Solution 1**: Wind speed-based weighting (0% at < 5 mph, 60% at > 20 mph) ✅

**Problem 2**: Slope threshold too high (10°) → 8.3° treated as "flat"  
**Solution 2**: Lowered threshold to 5° → Terrain logic on gentle slopes ✅

**Result**: 
- At 6 PM with 4.8 mph wind: **100% thermal + deer positioning** (0° north)
- On 8.3° slope: **Terrain-based stratification** (bedding south, feeding north)
- **Matches your field observations perfectly!** 🌡️🎯

**Deployment**: ✅ Backend restarted in 2.8 seconds (volume mounts FTW!)

## 🔄 **Next Test:**

Run a new prediction at your **6 PM location** (8.3° slope, 4.8 mph wind) and verify:
- Bedding appears SOUTH (uphill)
- Feeding appears NORTH (downhill)
- Evening stand appears NORTH (on deer travel route, not pulled east by weak wind)
- Log shows "🌅 THERMAL DOMINANT: Wind speed=4.8mph, Wind weight=0%"

**The thermal drafts you're feeling should now be properly modeled!** 🌬️🦌
