# The North-Facing Slope Problem - VISUAL EXPLANATION

## ❌ **OLD BEHAVIOR** (Feeding UPHILL!)

```
Your Location: North-facing slope
Aspect: 354° (points north downhill)
Slope: 12.8°

                RIDGE (South, HIGH Elevation)
                        ↑
                   [FEEDING] ← Elevation 352m (HIGHER!)
                   Aspect: 180° (south-facing)
                   "Better food quality" ❌
                        ↑
                    ⛰️ UPHILL
                        ↑
              [BEDDING 1, 2, 3] ← Elevation 339m
              Bearing: ~174° (S/SSE)
                        ↑
                 📍 Input Point
                 Elevation: 339m
                 Aspect: 354° (N)
                        ↓
                  Evening Stand
                 Bearing: ~354° (N)
                        ↓
                VALLEY (North, LOW Elevation)


❌ PROBLEM: Deer would have to walk UPHILL at 7 PM!
❌ Against thermal drafts (downslope evening wind)
❌ Against gravity
❌ Biologically incorrect
```

## ✅ **NEW BEHAVIOR** (Feeding DOWNHILL!)

```
Your Location: North-facing slope  
Aspect: 354° (points north downhill)
Slope: 12.8°
Time: 7:00 PM (PM HUNT)

                RIDGE (South, HIGH Elevation)
                        ↑
              [BEDDING 1, 2, 3] ← Elevation 339m+
              Bearing: ~174° (S/SSE)
              "Uphill for security" ✅
                        ↑
                 📍 Input Point
                 Elevation: 339m
                 Aspect: 354° (N)
                        ↓
                  Evening Stand
                 Bearing: ~354° (N)
                 "Intercept route" ✅
                        ↓
                    ⛰️ DOWNHILL
                        ↓
                   [FEEDING] ← Elevation <339m (LOWER!)
                   Bearing: ~354° (N)
                   "Follow thermal drafts" ✅
                        ↓
                VALLEY (North, LOW Elevation)
                  (water, food, cover)


✅ SOLUTION: Deer walk DOWNHILL at 7 PM!
✅ With thermal drafts (downslope evening wind)
✅ With gravity
✅ Biologically correct

## 🔑 **The Key Fix:**

### **OLD Logic**:
```python
# ALWAYS required south-facing aspect (135-225°)
aspect_suitable = 135 <= aspect <= 225

if not aspect_suitable:
    # Search for south-facing alternatives
    # On north slopes → Search goes UPHILL ❌
```

### **NEW Logic**:
```python
# Check TIME OF DAY first
is_pm_hunt = time_of_day >= 15

if is_pm_hunt and slope > 5:
    # PM HUNT: Downhill movement OVERRIDES aspect
    aspect_suitable = True  # Skip aspect check
    # Use downhill direction (thermal drafts) ✅
else:
    # AM HUNT: Aspect matters (food quality)
    aspect_suitable = 135 <= aspect <= 225
```

## 🦌 **Deer Behavior Explained:**

### **PM Hunt (3 PM - 8 PM)**:
```
Bedding (uphill) ──────────> Feeding (downhill)
   "Get up"              "Evening meal"

Movement Priority:
1. Thermal drafts (downslope wind)
2. Gravity (easier downhill)
3. Scent control (wind direction)
4. Food quality (SECONDARY)

Result: ALWAYS move downhill ✅
```

### **AM Hunt (5 AM - 11 AM)**:
```
Feeding ──────────> Bedding (uphill)
"Finish meal"    "Go to bed"

Food Priority:
1. Food quality (south-facing = better mast)
2. Browse nutrition (southern exposure)
3. THEN move uphill to bed

Result: Food location > terrain ✅
```

## 📍 **Your Specific Case:**

```
Location: North-facing slope
Aspect: 354° (1° west of due north)
Slope: 12.8° (moderate)
Time: 7:00 PM (PM hunt)

Uphill Direction: 174° (S/SSE) ← Sun
Downhill Direction: 354° (N/NNW) ← Valley

OLD Code Decision:
"Aspect 354° unsuitable for feeding" ❌
"Search for south-facing alternatives" ❌
"Found feeding at aspect 180° (south)" ❌
= Feeding UPHILL (elevation 352m vs 339m) ❌

NEW Code Decision:
"PM HUNT on 12.8° slope" ✅
"Prioritizing DOWNHILL movement" ✅
"Aspect=354° - deer move downhill with thermal drafts" ✅
= Feeding DOWNHILL (elevation <339m) ✅
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **Run New Prediction, You Should See**:

**Backend Logs**:
```
🌅 PM HUNT on 12.8° slope: Prioritizing DOWNHILL movement (aspect=354°)
   ⬇️ Deer move downhill with thermal drafts in evening, regardless of aspect
🏔️ BEDDING: Uphill placement... on 12.8° slope
🌾 FEEDING: Slope=12.8° - placing DOWNHILL (354°) for valley food sources
```

**Map**:
```
North ↑

Feeding 3 (N) ← Downhill
Feeding 2 (N) ← Downhill
Feeding 1 (N) ← Downhill
     ↑
Evening Stand (N) ← Intercept
     ↑
📍 Input Point
     ↑
Bedding 3 (S) ← Uphill
Bedding 2 (S) ← Uphill  
Bedding 1 (S) ← Uphill

South ↓
```

**No More**:
```
❌ "PRIMARY FEEDING LOCATION REJECTED"
❌ "FEEDING FALLBACK SEARCH"
❌ "SUITABLE FEEDING SITE FOUND: Aspect: 180°"
❌ Feeding zones ABOVE bedding zones
```
