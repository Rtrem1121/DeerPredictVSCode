## 🚀 **Railway Environment Variables**

**Add these in Railway dashboard:**
```bash
# Your specific values
GEE_PROJECT_ID=deer-hunting-satellite-123456
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials/gee-service-account.json
```

## 🦌 **What This Enables in Your App**

### **Satellite Hunting Intelligence:**
- **🌽 Crop Analysis:** Track harvest timing for deer movement
- **🌿 Vegetation Health:** NDVI analysis for food source quality  
- **🏞️ Terrain Modeling:** Elevation data for bedding area prediction
- **💧 Water Sources:** Identify streams, ponds, and wetlands
- **📊 Habitat Scoring:** Scientific analysis of deer habitat quality

### **Real Hunting Scenarios:**
```
Traditional: "I think deer might be in this area"
Your App: "Satellite shows optimal vegetation density here"

Traditional: "Wonder when corn gets harvested" 
Your App: "Crop analysis shows harvest completed 3 days ago"

Traditional: "Looking for bedding areas"
Your App: "Terrain model identifies 3 optimal bedding locations"
```
