# Tinmouth Vermont Diagnostic Test Results
## Algorithm Validation Analysis

**Test Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Location:** Tinmouth, VT (43.3146, -73.2178)  
**Objective:** Determine if low bedding suitability scores reflect environmental limitations or algorithm issues

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL FINDING: Algorithm Issue Detected**

- **App Score:** 43.1%
- **Independent Score:** 64.6%
- **Difference:** +21.5% (significant discrepancy)

**Diagnosis:** The substantial difference (>15%) between the app's output and independent calculation suggests an **algorithm issue** rather than genuine environmental limitations.

## üö® ALGORITHM ISSUE ANALYSIS

### Evidence of Algorithm Problems

1. **Significant Score Discrepancy (21.5%)**
   - Independent calculation: 64.6%
   - App reported: 43.1%
   - Difference exceeds 15% threshold for concern

2. **Strong Environmental Factors Not Reflected**
   - Excellent road isolation (568m) should score highly
   - Good canopy cover (65%) provides security
   - Strong wind protection from current conditions

3. **Possible Root Causes**
   - **Data Integration Failure:** App may not be receiving correct values from APIs
   - **Scoring Algorithm Bug:** Weight calculations or component scoring logic errors
   - **Weight Miscalibration:** Different weightings than biological expectations
   - **Temporal Data Issues:** App using stale or incorrect weather/environmental data

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED ALGORITHM INVESTIGATION

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Data Source Verification**
   ```python
   # Verify app's data fetching matches these results:
   # - Road distance: 568m (should score 100% for isolation)
   # - Canopy: ~65% (should score 87.5% for security)
   # - Slope: 25.9¬∞ (correctly penalized as too steep)
   ```

2. **Component Weight Audit**
   - Verify isolation and canopy weights (should be highest priority)
   - Check if aspect scoring is overly penalizing north-facing slopes
   - Confirm thermal calculations are working correctly

3. **Scoring Logic Review**
   - Test app's calculation with known input values
   - Compare intermediate component scores with independent results
   - Look for data type or unit conversion errors

### Specific Code Areas to Check

1. **Data Integration Layer**
   - OSM road distance calculations
   - Weather API data parsing
   - Terrain analysis accuracy

2. **Scoring Algorithm**
   - Component score calculations
   - Weight application logic
   - Final score aggregation

3. **Configuration Issues**
   - Verify correct API endpoints
   - Check data source timeouts/fallbacks
   - Confirm calculation parameters match biological criteria

## üå≤ ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Despite the algorithm issue, the environmental analysis reveals:

### Positive Factors
- ‚úÖ **Excellent Isolation:** 568m from roads (ideal for mature bucks)
- ‚úÖ **Good Forest Cover:** 65% canopy provides security
- ‚úÖ **Wind Protection:** Current conditions favor leeward positioning

### Limiting Factors
- ‚ùå **Excessive Slope:** 25.9¬∞ is steeper than optimal 5-20¬∞ range
- ‚ùå **Poor Aspect:** 23¬∞ (NNE) lacks thermal advantage of south-facing slopes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate Temperature:** 53.3¬∞F reduces thermal-seeking behavior

### True Environmental Score
The independent calculation of **64.6%** likely represents a more accurate assessment of the area's moderate suitability for mature buck bedding.

## üìã NEXT STEPS

### For Algorithm Improvement
1. **Immediate:** Debug data integration and scoring logic
2. **Short-term:** Implement component-level logging for transparency
3. **Long-term:** Add validation tests using known-good locations

### For Field Application
1. The Tinmouth area has **moderate potential** (64.6% vs 43.1%)
2. Focus on nearby south-facing slopes with gentler gradients
3. Prioritize similar isolation but better aspect/slope combinations
