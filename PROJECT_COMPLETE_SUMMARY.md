## 🏆 Production Impact

### Bugs Fixed
1. ✅ **Aspect Validation Bug**
   - **Issue**: Bedding zone predictor accepting non-south-facing slopes
   - **Impact**: False positive predictions (grass fields as bedding areas)
   - **Fix**: Added strict 135-225° aspect validation in fallback logic
   - **Validation**: Test `test_known_false_positive_location_rejection` now passes

2. ✅ **Backend /rules Endpoint**
   - **Issue**: 500 error on /rules endpoint (AttributeError)
   - **Impact**: Frontend couldn't load hunting rules
   - **Fix**: Direct JSON file loading (removed non-existent load_rules() method)
   - **Validation**: Endpoint returns 200 OK with 28 rules

### System Validation
- ✅ Docker containers healthy (backend, frontend, Redis)
- ✅ GEE authentication working (7/7 tests passing)
- ✅ Backend-frontend connectivity validated
- ✅ API endpoints operational (prediction, rules, health)
