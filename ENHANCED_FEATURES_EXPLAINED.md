## 💡 **Recommendation for You**

### **Start with Core Features:**
```bash
# Railway Environment Variables (Minimum)
BACKEND_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
PORT=8501
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

### **Add Enhanced Features Later:**
1. **Deploy with core features first** → Test everything works
2. **Add SECRET_KEY** → When you want user accounts
3. **Add GEE_PROJECT_ID** → When you want satellite intelligence

---

## 🔧 **How to Add Enhanced Features**

### **Option 1: Add During Initial Deployment**
In Railway dashboard → Variables → Add all at once

### **Option 2: Add Later (Recommended)**
1. Deploy with core features
2. Test on iPhone
3. Add enhanced features one by one
4. Test each addition

---

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Your deer hunting app is AMAZING with just the core features!**

**Enhanced features are like upgrading from:**
- 🎯 **Core:** Professional hunting app
