Each cell = ~440m √ó 350m
Each cell has GPS coordinates (lat, lon)
Each cell has food quality score (0-1)
```

### Data Sampling Strategy
1. **Create 10x10 grid** around center point (lat, lon)
2. **Sample USDA CDL** at each grid point (100m buffer)
3. **Classify crop type** using Vermont crop classifications
4. **Apply seasonal quality** based on season (early/rut/late)
5. **Create quality heatmap** across hunting area
6. **Identify high-quality patches** (top 25% = best food)

## üìç Food Patch Detection

### High-Quality Patch Identification
```python
# Top 25% of grid cells are identified as "high-quality food patches"
threshold = np.percentile(food_grid, 75)
high_quality_cells = food_grid >= threshold

# Example output:
{
  'food_patch_locations': [
    {
      'lat': 44.2612,
      'lon': -72.5785,
      'quality': 0.95,  # Corn field
      'grid_cell': {'row': 2, 'col': 6}
    },
    {
      'lat': 44.2598,
      'lon': -72.5823,
      'quality': 0.85,  # Oak forest (mast)
      'grid_cell': {'row': 4, 'col': 3}
    },
    // ... up to 10 patches
  ]
}
```

### Stand Placement Integration
- **Before**: Stand placement used generic feeding areas
- **After**: Stand placement can target specific GPS coordinates of corn fields, mast production areas

Example: "Place stand at 44.2612¬∞N, 72.5785¬∞W (225m SE of center) near corn field (quality: 0.95)"

## üìä Spatial Grid Benefits

### Before Phase 3
```python
# Generic food score applied uniformly
feeding_scores = np.ones((10, 10)) * 0.72

# No spatial information
# No GPS coordinates of food
# Stand placement uses generic "feeding areas"
```

### After Phase 3
```python
# Spatial food quality map
feeding_scores = array([
  [4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0],
  [5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5],  # Corn row
  ...
])

# GPS coordinates of best food
best_food_patch = {
  'lat': 44.2760,
  'lon': -72.5640,
  'quality': 0.95,
  'type': 'Corn field'
}

# Stand placement: "225m SE of center, downwind of corn field"
```

### Key Improvements
- **Spatial Resolution**: 100 cells vs. 1 uniform score
- **GPS Accuracy**: Exact coordinates of food sources
- **Stand Placement**: Target specific food patches
- **Quality Distribution**: See food quality heatmap
- **Patch Ranking**: Top 10 food locations identified

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. **Precision Stand Placement**
**Problem**: "Where should I put my stand?"

**Before**: "Near feeding areas" (vague)

**After Phase 3**:
```python
# Best food patch identified at GPS coordinates
stand_recommendation = {
  'location': {'lat': 44.2760, 'lon': -72.5640},
  'distance_from_center': '225m SE',
  'food_type': 'Corn field',
  'food_quality': 0.95,
  'reason': 'Standing corn during rut - prime energy source',
  'setup': 'Downwind approach, 30 yards from field edge'
}
```

### 2. **Food Source Scouting**
**Problem**: "What food sources are in this area?"

**After Phase 3**:
```python
# Top 5 food patches with GPS coordinates
1. Corn field: 44.2760, -72.5640 (quality: 0.95)
2. Oak forest: 44.2720, -72.5800 (quality: 0.85) - mast
3. Hay field: 44.2680, -72.5720 (quality: 0.70)
4. Mixed forest: 44.2640, -72.5840 (quality: 0.65)
5. Shrubland: 44.2600, -72.5680 (quality: 0.60) - browse
```

### 3. **Seasonal Strategy Planning**
**Problem**: "How do food sources change through the season?"

**After Phase 3**:
```python
# Same area, different seasons
Early Season (Sept): Oak forest dominates (0.85)
Rut (Nov): Corn fields peak (0.95)
Late Season (Dec): Corn stubble remains high (0.90)

# Plan: Hunt oak forests early, transition to corn for rut
```

## üí° Key Insights

### Why Spatial Mapping Matters

**Example Scenario**: Two stands, same area

**Stand A (Generic)**:
- Location: Center of hunting area
- Food intel: "Moderate food nearby"
- Success: 50/50

**Stand B (Spatial Grid)**:
- Location: 44.2760¬∞N, 72.5640¬∞W
- Food intel: "Corn field 95% quality, 225m SE"
- Setup: "Downwind edge, evening approach"
- Success: Much higher confidence

The difference is **PRECISION**. Instead of "there's food somewhere nearby," you know:
- **WHAT** food (corn)
- **WHERE** exactly (GPS coordinates)
- **HOW GOOD** (0.95 quality = excellent)
- **WHEN** to hunt it (rut season peak)

---

## üéì Vermont Hunting Application

### Real-World Scenario

**Hunter**: "I have 80 acres in Montpelier, VT. Where's the best spot for rut season?"

**App Response (with Phase 3)**:
```
üåΩ SPATIAL FOOD ANALYSIS:
   - 3 high-quality food sources identified
   - Best: Corn field at 44.2760¬∞N, 72.5640¬∞W
   - Quality: 0.95 (excellent for rut)
   - Location: 225m southeast of your pin

üéØ STAND RECOMMENDATION:
   - Setup: 30 yards downwind of corn field edge
   - Coordinates: 44.2757¬∞N, 72.5643¬∞W
   - Wind: NW wind ideal (scent blown away from field)
   - Timing: Evening hunt (deer feeding 4-6pm)
   
üìç BACKUP LOCATIONS:
   1. Oak forest (mast): 44.2720¬∞N, 72.5800¬∞W (quality: 0.85)
   2. Field edge: 44.2680¬∞N, 72.5720¬∞W (quality: 0.70)
```

Now the hunter can:
1. Navigate to exact GPS coordinates
2. Scout the corn field before season
3. Set up stand with confidence
4. Know why this spot is good (data-driven)
