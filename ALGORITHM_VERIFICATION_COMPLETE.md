- **Wisconsin Test (44.5, -89.5)**: Travel: 3, Bedding: 0, Feeding: 3, Mature Buck: 0
- **Trail Camera System**: 3 strategic placements with professional setup guidance

**🔬 ALGORITHM SOURCES VERIFIED:**
- **Bedding Zones**: `rules.json` + `deep_forest` terrain feature (6 behavior rules)
- **Travel Corridors**: Slope analysis + natural terrain funneling algorithms
- **Feeding Areas**: Food source proximity + seasonal availability factors
- **Mature Buck Opportunities**: Terrain suitability + pressure resistance (60% threshold)
- **Trail Cameras**: Strategic positioning based on movement pattern analysis

**📊 CONFIDENCE SCORING CONFIRMED:**
- Travel Corridor: 88.3% (terrain-based slope algorithm)
- Bedding Zone: 50.2% (rule-matching algorithm from rules.json)
- Feeding Area: 90.0% (food source proximity algorithm)
- Mature Buck: 43.5% (below 60% threshold - correctly excluded)

**🎪 REALISTIC BEHAVIOR VERIFIED:**
- ✅ Sparse forest areas show 0 bedding zones (realistic deer behavior)
- ✅ Dense forest areas show multiple bedding zones (realistic habitat)
- ✅ Mature buck opportunities only appear when terrain meets strict criteria
- ✅ All confidence scores reflect actual algorithmic calculations

## **🆕 TRAIL CAMERA PLACEMENT SYSTEM**

### **🎥 Professional Trail Camera Recommendations**
```json
{
  "placement_types": [
    "travel_funnel",     // 90% confidence - natural corridors
    "scrape_line",       // 95% confidence - rutting activity
    "water_source",      // 80% confidence - hydration needs
    "feeding_edge",      // 85% confidence - food transitions
    "escape_route",      // 75% confidence - safety corridors
    "saddle_pass"        // 88% confidence - terrain funnels
  ]
}
```

### **📸 Setup Specifications:**
- **Height**: 10-12 feet above ground
- **Angle**: 30° downward angle for optimal coverage
- **Timing**: Dawn/dusk activation with motion sensitivity
- **Wind Consideration**: Downwind positioning from predicted travel routes
- **Season Focus**: Rut = scrape lines, Early/Late = feeding/water sources

## **🏹 MATURE BUCK PREDICTION ANALYSIS**

### **🎯 Terrain Suitability Scoring System:**
```python
mature_buck_criteria = {
    "bedding_suitability": 0.45,      # Secure bedding areas
    "escape_route_quality": 0.42,     # Multiple escape options
    "isolation_score": 0.40,          # Distance from human activity
    "pressure_resistance": 0.47       # Historical pressure data
}
# Overall: 43.5% (Below 60% threshold - No opportunities shown)
```

**✅ REALISTIC BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED:**
- Algorithm correctly excludes marginal habitat (43.5% < 60%)
- Only prime locations with 60%+ suitability show mature buck opportunities
- Prevents false positives in sub-optimal terrain

## **🔧 CORE ALGORITHM DETAILS**

### **1. Bedding Zone Algorithm**
```python
# Uses 6 deer behavior rules from rules.json:
rules = [
    "thick_cover_bedding",     # Dense vegetation requirement
    "elevation_bedding",       # Elevated positions preferred
    "water_proximity_bedding", # Near but not too close to water
    "wind_advantage_bedding",  # Wind direction considerations
    "escape_route_bedding",    # Multiple exit strategies
    "thermal_cover_bedding"    # Temperature regulation
]

# Terrain features required:
terrain_features = ["deep_forest", "elevation", "water_distance", "slope"]
```

### **2. Travel Corridor Algorithm**
```python
# Terrain-based movement prediction:
def calculate_travel_corridors(terrain_grid):
    slope_analysis = calculate_slope_preferences()
    natural_funnels = identify_terrain_bottlenecks()
    cover_transitions = find_habitat_edges()
    return weighted_corridor_score()
```

### **3. Feeding Area Algorithm**
```python
# Food source proximity analysis:
food_sources = {
    "agricultural_fields": 0.9,   # High preference
    "oak_groves": 0.8,           # Acorn production
    "apple_orchards": 0.85,      # Fruit availability
    "crop_edges": 0.75,          # Transition zones
    "natural_browse": 0.6        # Native vegetation
}
```
