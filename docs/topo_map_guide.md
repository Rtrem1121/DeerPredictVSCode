# Topographic Map Reading Guide for Deer Hunters

## ü¶å **Deer Movement and Topographic Features**

### **Travel Corridors**
- **Saddles**: Low points between hills - natural crossing points
- **Ridge Lines**: Deer travel along ridges for safety and scent advantage
- **Creek Bottoms**: Natural highways, especially during dry periods
- **Field Edges**: Transition zones between cover and food

### **Bedding Areas** 
- **North-facing Slopes**: Cooler in summer, protected from sun
- **Thick Contour Lines**: Steep, difficult terrain for predators
- **1/3 up hillsides**: Common bedding elevation
- **Near Escape Routes**: Close to thick cover or multiple exit paths

### **Feeding Areas**
- **South-facing Slopes**: Warmer, better browse growth
- **Field Edges**: Agricultural areas and food plots
- **Wide Contour Spacing**: Gentle slopes, easier to feed
- **Creek Bottoms**: Rich soil, diverse plant life

## üó∫Ô∏è **Reading Contour Lines**

### **Contour Line Patterns**
- **Close Together**: Steep terrain
- **Far Apart**: Gentle slopes
- **V-Shaped pointing uphill**: Valley or draw
- **V-Shaped pointing downhill**: Ridge or spur
- **Circular**: Hill or depression

### **Elevation and Deer Behavior**
- **20-40 ft elevation change**: Ideal funnel areas
- **Multiple benches**: Staging areas before entering fields
- **Elevation drops near water**: Natural travel routes

## üì± **Using the App with Topo Maps**

### **Best Map Types for Different Scenarios**

1. **Initial Scouting**: Use **USGS Topographic** or **Satellite**
   - Identify major terrain features
   - Locate water sources and food areas

2. **Stand Placement**: Use **USGS Topographic** with **Contour Overlay**
   - Find specific elevation changes
   - Identify funnel points and travel routes

3. **Access Planning**: Use **Street Map** or **USGS Topographic**
   - Plan quiet entry/exit routes
   - Avoid disturbing bedding areas

### **Overlay Options**
- **Contour Lines**: Essential for elevation reading
- **Terrain Shading**: Shows slope steepness visually
- **Satellite + Contours**: Best of both worlds

## üéØ **Prediction Analysis Tips**

When viewing predictions on topographic maps:

1. **Cross-reference** prediction zones with terrain features
2. **Look for confirmation** - do predicted bedding areas match north slopes?
3. **Check elevation changes** - are travel corridors following natural terrain?
4. **Verify water access** - are feeding areas near water sources?

## üîç **Common Hunting Scenarios**

### **Morning Hunts**
- Look for travel routes from bedding (ridges) to feeding (fields/bottoms)
- Focus on saddles and ridge intersections

### **Evening Hunts** 
- Target feeding areas and approaches to food sources
- South-facing slopes and field edges

### **Rut Season**
- Ridge systems for cruising bucks
- Saddles and pinch points between doe bedding areas

Remember: **Topographic maps show the "why" behind deer movement!**
