### üöÄ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### A. Core Algorithm Fixes
```python
# BEFORE (Enhanced Algorithm - Overly Restrictive)
canopy_threshold = 0.70  # 70% - Too restrictive for Vermont
road_distance_threshold = 200  # Too far for realistic assessment

# AFTER (Production Fix - Realistic Thresholds)  
canopy_threshold = 0.55  # 55% - Realistic for Vermont terrain
road_distance_threshold = 120  # Realistic road impact distance
```

#### B. Production Service Integration
```python
# Initialize bedding fix in constructor
self.bedding_fix = PredictionServiceBeddingFix()

# Replace enhanced bedding generation with fixed algorithm
if self.bedding_fix:
    fixed_bedding_zones = self.bedding_fix.generate_fixed_bedding_zones_for_prediction_service(
        context.lat, context.lon, gee_data, osm_data, enhanced_weather
    )
```
