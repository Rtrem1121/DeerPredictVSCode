# Vermont White-tailed Deer Movement Prediction System

## üèîÔ∏è Overview

This enhanced deer movement prediction system is specifically optimized for Vermont's unique ecological conditions, incorporating state-specific deer behavior patterns, terrain features, and weather influences. The system uses advanced terrain analysis, real-time weather integration, and Vermont Fish & Wildlife data to provide accurate hunting location recommendations.

- **NEW**: Apple orchards and beech groves during rut (high energy needs)
- **NEW**: Conifer browse areas for winter survival

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Enhancements

### Advanced Terrain Analysis

The system now uses sophisticated mathematical models for terrain feature detection:

#### 1. Enhanced Ridge Detection
```python
# Uses Laplacian curvature for better Vermont hill detection
curvature = laplace(elevation_grid)
ridge_top = (curvature < 0) & (slope > 10)  # Lower threshold for rolling hills
```

#### 2. Saddle (Mountain Pass) Detection
```python
# Principal curvature analysis identifies natural funnels
discriminant = np.sqrt((hessian_xx - hessian_yy)**2 + 4*hessian_xy**2)
curv1 = (hessian_xx + hessian_yy + discriminant) / 2
curv2 = (hessian_xx + hessian_yy - discriminant) / 2
saddle = (curv1 > 0) & (curv2 < 0) & (slope < 15)
```

#### 3. Winter Yard Identification
```python
# Identifies dense conifer stands below 2000ft elevation
winter_yard_potential = conifer_dense & (elevation_grid < 610)
```

#### 4. Bluff Pinch Point Detection
```python
# Finds steep terrain features that funnel deer movement
bluff_pinch = (slope > 35) & (np.abs(curvature) > np.percentile(np.abs(curvature), 85))
```

### Weather Integration

The system now fetches and analyzes real-time weather data:

- **Snow Depth Monitoring**: Triggers winter behavior patterns
- **Barometric Pressure Tracking**: Detects cold fronts that increase deer activity
- **Wind Analysis**: Identifies leeward slopes for bedding predictions
- **Temperature Thresholds**: Adjusts behavior based on Vermont's climate patterns

### Seasonal Behavior Modeling

#### Early Season (September - Mid-October)
- **Behavior Focus**: Pattern establishment
- **Feeding Priority**: Increased by 20%
- **Key Foods**: Acorns, apples, browse
- **Movement**: Short range (0.5-1 mile)

#### Rut Season (Mid-October - Mid-December)
- **Behavior Focus**: Breeding activity
- **Travel Priority**: Increased by 30%
- **Key Foods**: High-energy browse, remaining mast
- **Movement**: Extended range (5-15 miles for bucks)

#### Late Season (Mid-December - March)
- **Behavior Focus**: Survival and conservation
- **Bedding Priority**: Increased by 50%
- **Key Foods**: Woody browse, conifer tips
- **Movement**: Minimal (winter yard concentration)

## üìä Confidence Scoring

The Vermont-enhanced system uses research-based confidence scores:

### High Confidence (85-95%)
- Deep forest bedding (95% - Vermont's extensive forests)
- Dense conifer winter yards (90% - critical for survival)
- Ridge travel during rut (90% - Green Mountain tracking data)
- Valley feeding areas (90% - documented patterns)

### Medium Confidence (70-85%)
- Apple orchards during rut (85% - high energy needs)
- Conifer travel lanes in snow (85% - winter yarding patterns)
- Saddle pinch points (90% - natural funnels)
- Hardwood benches (75% - mast integration)

### Moderate Confidence (60-75%)
- Conifer browse areas (75% - winter survival)
- Bluff pinch points (75% - mountainous terrain)
- General forest edges (60% - common in mixed habitats)

## üå®Ô∏è Winter Severity Index

The system calculates winter conditions and adjusts predictions:

### Snow Depth Thresholds
- **>10 inches**: Triggers conifer corridor use
- **>16 inches**: Activates winter yard concentration
- **>24 inches**: Severe winter conditions - minimal movement

### Temperature Impacts
- **<0¬∞F**: Severe conditions - bedding area emphasis
- **0-14¬∞F**: Moderate winter - balanced activities
- **>14¬∞F**: Mild conditions - normal patterns

2. **Thermal Bedding**: South-facing slopes in winter
3. **Mast Production**: Oak and beech areas
4. **Travel Funnels**: Saddles and ridge connections

### Distance Weighting

- **0.5-1 mile**: High priority (reasonable access)
- **1-2 miles**: Moderate priority (hiking distance)
- **>2 miles**: Lower priority (significant travel)

## üéØ Usage Recommendations

### For Vermont Hunters
1. **Focus on Elevation Zones**: 1000-2000 ft elevation optimal
2. **Monitor Snow Conditions**: >10" triggers winter patterns
3. **Watch Weather Fronts**: Barometric drops increase activity
4. **Consider Wind Direction**: Northwest winds common in Vermont

### Seasonal Strategies
